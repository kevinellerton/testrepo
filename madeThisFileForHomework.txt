I'm using this file for practice.

This could be an HTML file, or a JS file, or any other code file.

I suppose that if it was, I would edit it in Sublime Text, not in nano. Right?

Oh yeah, I had a question!

Why would anyone ever need to "git add" and not "git commit" at the same time?

What would be the use case of that?

And if there's no normal use case, why not just create a shortcut...

git add + git commit?

also, what about git push and git pull and git merge? i have a lot to learn.
